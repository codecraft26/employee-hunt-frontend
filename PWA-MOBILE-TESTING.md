2. Install prompt will show manual instructions
3. Follow: Share → Add to Home Screen → Add

### Debug Mode:
1. Look for red "PWA Debug" button (top-right)
2. Click to see detailed PWA information
3. Use "Reset Install Prompt" to test again
4. Export debug info for troubleshooting

## Common Issues & Solutions

### ❌ No Install Prompt Showing
**Possible Causes:**
- App already installed → Clear browser data or use incognito
- Not served over HTTPS → Use HTTPS or localhost
- Browser doesn't support PWAs → Test on Chrome/Safari
- Install prompt dismissed before → Reset via debug panel

**Solutions:**
1. Clear browser cache and data
2. Use incognito/private browsing mode
3. Check PWA Debug panel for details
4. Ensure service worker is registered

### ❌ iOS Safari Not Working
**Note:** iOS Safari doesn't support automatic install prompts.
**Solution:** Manual installation instructions are shown instead.

### ❌ Service Worker Errors
**Check:**
1. Console errors during registration
2. Network tab for failed SW requests
3. Application tab → Service Workers in DevTools

### ❌ Manifest Issues
**Check:**
1. Manifest loads without errors (Network tab)
2. All required fields present
3. Icons accessible and correct sizes

## Development Commands

# Start development server
npm run dev
